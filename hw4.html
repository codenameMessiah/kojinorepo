<p>For the image titled "black_vs_white" I wanted to portray the opposition of black and white peoples in America. For the backdrop I decided to use an image of a background from the video game "Dragon Ball FighterZ" of a planet in ruin, on the brink of destruction. I used this backdrop because I feel as though the constant black vs. white issues in America will eventually lead to something as catastrophic as a planet being destroyed. The black and white creatures I used are the mascots of the Pokémon Black and White games, where the white one is the mascot of Pokémon Black, and the black one is the mascot for Pokémon White. I felt as though these two opposing creatures are great for representing the racial conflict I speak of.

For the image titled "kabuto_darkkabuto_uchuuni" I used two online images. The portrayed characters are from the Japanese tokusatsu drama "Kamen Rider Kabuto", where the blue eyed figure is the titular character and the yellow eyed figure is his evil counterpart "Dark Kabuto". I wanted to portray the inner battle one may have within themselves. The "good" you versus the "dark" or "evil" you. I had Dark Kabuto be a larger part of the background to represent how dark thoughts can have an overwhelming presence in one's mind. And an image of space was used to represent the mind itself, as it is a space in its own rite.</p>

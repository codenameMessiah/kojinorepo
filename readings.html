	The advent of photography and cameras brought forth a great shift in the world of media consumption. With media such as paintings or drawings, or written articles, some things can get lost in translation. A painting or drawing of a place in nature can have inaccuracies that don’t properly illustrate the beauty of that place. The information in written pieces can easily be misinterpreted or even be completely incorrect, misleading those who would read them. With photography, these issues practically disappear. Cameras are capable of capturing moments in time in their entirety. With a photograph, no details get left out. If something unbelievable happens to someone and they try to speak about it with others who don’t believe it happened,  having a photograph of the event would force people to believe it happened. Photographs are a nigh undeniable medium showing proof of the world. 
When cameras were invented, it became immediately apparent how useful a device they would be. As stated in “In Plato’s Cave”, photos were being used to round up Communards in Paris in 1871. “photographs became a useful tool of modern states in the surveillance and control of their increasingly mobile populations. In another version of its utility, the camera record justifies.” (In Plato’s Cave from On Photography, Susan Sontag, 1977) 
Susan Sontag did a fine job of illustrating the line between a photograph and the art of taking them. While a photograph is something of a record of events given the form of an image, Sontag compares the act of taking a photograph to “sexual voyeurism.” (Which is ironic, seeing as taking photos could be a literal part of sexual voyeurism) She writes, “Like sexual voyeurism, it is a way of at least tacitly, often explicitly, encouraging whatever is going on to keep happening. To take a picture is to have an interest in things as they are, in the status quo remaining unchanged… including, when that is the interest, another person’s pain or misfortune.” I believe this quote brings the morality of photography to question. There exists a myriad of photographs of events and locations over the past two centuries. Images of both beautiful and hellish scenery. For every photograph of a creek or a mountain range, there is one of the aftermath of a war. There are photographs of children being herded like cattle by soldiers as prisoners of war. Taking photos such as these is quite a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is important to show the horrors of war to the masses, to encourage stopping such battles and maintaining peace by appealing to the empathy of those who would view these photographs. But on the other hand, photographers are documenting the pain of innocent people, who might not even want the world to see them in such a state. Is it morally correct to let the world know the horrors that lie beneath its exterior? Or is it better to protect the dignity of those that become victims to the cruelty of life?

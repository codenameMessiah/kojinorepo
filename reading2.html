In the story of Kadiatu, the story is told using illustrations along side words, in a fashion not unlike comic books/manga. It is telling the story of a woman from Sierra Leon who experienced being a victim to her country's disadvantageous healthcare system. Kadiatu has suffered so much mental anguish surrounding her experiences with losing children to childbirth. On top of having lost children, which is already an incomprehensible thing for a mother to face, she had to face bullying from other women in her village. For losing her child she did not receive much in the way of support. She instead was isolated and gossiped about. She was told the only reasons her children could have been lost was because she was either a witch or possessed by some kind of demon. Her eighth pregnancy was a Herculean trial. She had to leave her child in her brother’s care, leaving in a packed car on a two hour journey to a clinic, all while she was in immense pain. When she arrived, she realized this clinic is where they brought victims of the Ebola virus, which was rampant at the time illustrated in this comic. An unsafe environment for childbirth to say the least. Despite all these conditions, her child Fatmata was born after she spent three months in the clinic under treatment. Her son Abdul fell ill 18 months after this. She once again was sent to a traditional healer, who told her nothing of use once again. Luckily Abdul survived. 
The usage of illustrations to tell this story enabled a different level of emotions to be displayed. It would be nigh impossible to tell this story using real images, because real images of Kafiatu’s wouldn’t have been possible to obtain. This is Kadiatu’s story, told through her own perspective and what she witnessed and heard. Unless she had a camera on her at all times (which she obviously didn’t), the only way to use imagery to tell her story, would be through illustration. It also works in her favor to use illustration, because the despair of her situation could properly be illustrated. Every drawing in this comic had a ton of emotion behind it. From the illustrations of Kadiatu’s frustration towards her husband and the spiritual healer, to the happiness she felt when her holding her newborn child Fatmata, to the fear of her son Abdul getting sick and being at risk of dying. Every drawing conveyed Kadiatu’s feelings perfectly. Had real life imagery been used, these feelings might have been lost in translation.

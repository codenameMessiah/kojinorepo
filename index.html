<h1>Khalonji Dash</h1>

<p>Hello all! My name is Khalonji Dash. I also go by Koji, Koko, Jiji, and Khal. I'm a Queens native bron to a Guyanese father and a Haitian mother. My two cultures are something very important to me and I reflect that in who I am as a person. I'm currently a Media Studies major at Hunter College focusing on Emerging Media I am in love with video games and tokusatsu (special effects shows and movies like Kamen Rider or Godzilla). It is a huge part of my identity as a human being. My dreams lie in combining these two forms of media into something amazing that everyone will enjoy. Game and music design are a passion of mine and I plan on using my skills in both forms of media to create projects that entertain all and make them happy! </p>

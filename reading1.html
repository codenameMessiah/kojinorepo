<h1>Photography and Truth</h1>

<p>
The advent of photography and cameras brought forth a great shift in the world of media consumption. With media such as paintings or drawings, or written articles, some things can get lost in translation. A painting or drawing of a place in nature can have inaccuracies that don’t properly illustrate the beauty of that place. The information in written pieces can easily be misinterpreted or even be completely incorrect, misleading those who would read them.
</p>

<p>
With photography, these issues practically disappear. Cameras are capable of capturing moments in time in their entirety. With a photograph, no details get left out. If something unbelievable happens to someone and they try to speak about it with others who don’t believe it happened, having a photograph of the event would force people to believe it happened. Photographs are a nigh undeniable medium showing proof of the world.

When cameras were invented, it became immediately apparent how useful a device they would be. As stated in “In Plato’s Cave”, photos were being used to round up Communards in Paris in 1871. “Photographs became a useful tool of modern states in the surveillance and control of their increasingly mobile populations. In another version of its utility, the camera record justifies.” (Susan Sontag, <em>On Photography</em>, 1977)

Susan Sontag did a fine job of illustrating the line between a photograph and the art of taking them. While a photograph is something of a record of events given the form of an image, Sontag compares the act of taking a photograph to “sexual voyeurism.” She writes, “Like sexual voyeurism, it is a way of at least tacitly, often explicitly, encouraging whatever is going on to keep happening… including, when that is the interest, another person’s pain or misfortune.”

I believe this quote brings the morality of photography into question. There exists a myriad of photographs of events and locations over the past two centuries—images of both beautiful and hellish scenery. For every photograph of a creek or a mountain range, there is one of the aftermath of a war.
</p>

<p>
Taking photos such as these is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is important to show the horrors of war to encourage empathy and peace. On the other hand, photographers are documenting the pain of innocent people who may not want the world to see them in such a state. Is it morally correct to expose these horrors, or is it better to protect the dignity of those who suffer?
